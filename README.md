# iOS Bootcamp

This repository contains all exercises developed during my 6-month self-guided iOS Developer bootcamp (Julâ€“Dec 2025)

I designed this program to go beyond tutorials and build real apps focused on:

- SwiftUI
- Swift Networking
- Swift Concurrency
- Persistence Data
- CI/CD and Unit Test
- Keychain and app security
- Modularization with SPM
- Clean, professional code
