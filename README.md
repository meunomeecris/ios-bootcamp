# üöÄ iOS Bootcamp

This repository contains all the exercises and projects developed during my **6-month self-guided iOS Developer bootcamp (Jul‚ÄìDec 2025)**.

I designed this program to go beyond tutorials and focus on building real apps using production-level techniques:

- SwiftUI
- Swift Networking
- Swift Concurrency
- Persistence Data
- CI/CD and Unit Test
- Keychain and app security
- Modularization with SPM
- Clean, professional code


## Concepts That I master
üß† Programming Fundamentals
  - Variables and Types (let vs var, Optionals, Dictionaries, Arrays‚Ä¶)
  - Control Flow (if, guard, switch, for, while)
  - Functions (with parameters, closures, mutating)
  - Structs vs Classes (value vs reference types)
  - Access Control (private, public, etc.)

üçè SwiftUI and iOS
  - Building Views (@State, @Binding, @Observed Macro, NavigationStack, etc.)
  - View Lifecycle (onAppear, onDisappear)
  - Modularization and Reuse (custom init, small reusable components)
  - Common UI Techniques (forms, lists, alerts, loading states)

‚öôÔ∏è Concurrency and Basic Architecture
  - Async/Await
  - Task and structured concurrency
  - MVVM and clean separation of concerns
  - Avoiding common issues (e.g. force-unwrapping, mixing logic in Views)

üåê Swift Networking
  - Fetching data with URLSession + async/await
  - Decoding JSON using Codable
  - Proper error handling and user feedback
  - Building reusable and testable networking layers

üß™ Swift Testing
  - Writing clean @Test functions with #expect
  - Testing async code, state changes, and view logic
  - Mocking dependencies (e.g. fake network clients)
  - Organizing test suites for clarity and maintenance
