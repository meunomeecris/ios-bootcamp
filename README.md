#iOS Bootcamp

This repository contains all projects and exercises developed during my 6-month self-guided iOS Developer bootcamp (Julâ€“Dec 2025)

I designed this program to go beyond tutorials and build real apps focused on:

- SwiftUI
- MVVM architecture
- Swift Concurrency
- Persistence with Core Data
- CI/CD and testing
- Keychain and app security
- Clean, professional code
